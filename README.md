# legal-nlp-semantic-similarity
A legal NLP system that learns to understand how contract clauses relate in meaning — even when phrased differently. This project explores BiLSTM-based and Attention-based sentence encoders, trained end-to-end to detect meaningful legal similarity without relying on BERT or external embeddings.
